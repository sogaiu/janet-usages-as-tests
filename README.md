# janet-usages-as-tests

Generate and run tests from usage examples

## Status

Currently in transition to using
[janet-ex-as-tests](https://github.com/sogaiu/janet-ex-as-tests) (a
successor).

## Background

It can be useful to record usages (calls):

```janet
(peg/match ~(cmt (capture "hello")
                 ,(fn [cap]
                    (string cap "!")))
           "hello")
```

and the asssociated results:

```janet
@["hello!"]
```

that tend to arise while developing for later reference,
documentation, and/or reuse.

What if these pairs of things could also be used as tests?

```janet
(comment

  (peg/match ~(cmt (capture "hello")
                   ,(fn [cap]
                      (string cap "!")))
             "hello")
  # =>
  @["hello!"]

  )
```

`janet-usages-as-tests` is an evolution of
[usages-as-tests](https://github.com/sogaiu/usages-as-tests).  The
basic idea is the same once things are setup.

## Running Tests

### Repositories Using janet-usages-as-tests

Invoke `jpm test` as usual.

### This Repository

Invoking `jpm test` will not work for this repository as it is not set
up to be tested in that manner.

Instead, to test the code in this repository, invoke:
```
janet make-and-run-juat-tests.janet
```

## Setup and Configuration

There are a few ways `janet-usages-as-tests` can be used with some
target project.

The basic idea in each case is to put an appropriate `.janet` file in
the `test` subdirectory of the target project so that it is executed
when `jpm test` is invoked.

The aforementioned `.janet` file is a launching script for code in
`janet-usages-as-tests` and should also be edited to contain names of
files and directories in which to search for usages to convert into
tests.

Some directories are skipped in this process of searching for usages
(to turn into tests), including:

* `.git` directories
* directories containing a file named `.gitrepo`

### Copying In-Place

0. Clone this repository somewhere.

1. Copy just the subdirectory named `janet-usages-as-tests` of the
   cloned repository as a subdirectory of a target project.

2. Copy or move the included `make-and-run-juat-tests.janet` file into
   the `test` directory of the target project.

3. Edit `make-and-run-juat-tests.janet` to specify files and/or
   directories that are the target of usages to be treated as tests.

### Git Submodule

1. In place of step 1 above, add this repository as a submodule of a
   target project.

2. Copy or move the included `make-and-run-juat-tests-submodule.janet`
   file into the `test` directory of the target project.

3. Edit `make-and-run-juat-tests-submodule.janet` to specify files
   and/or directories that are the target of usages to be treated as
   tests.

## Writing Tests

Within `comment` blocks, put expressions / forms to be tested along
with expected values (or expressions):

```janet
(comment

  (- 1 1)
  # =>
  0

  )
```

Here `(- 1 1)` is the expression to be tested and `0` is the
corresponding expected value.  The instance of `# =>` indicates
the presence of a test / usage.

See [Usage / Test Writing Tips](./doc/tips.md) for more details.
